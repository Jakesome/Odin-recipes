Set up first website using HTML

The website will be a simple selection of recipies that we will be able
to navigate to via links. As my knowlege expands I will update it using
CSS and then JavaScript.

In order to start the process I will be showcasing my skills using HTML
to make a basic website including lists, links, images, paragraphs and
headers.

In this process I will also be performing my first Git commits and comm
ents.
